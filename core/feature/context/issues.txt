App category
- There is no other category. Derived streams will have missing data in case app doesn't match any app category on Goog play store
- CU_APPUSAGE--edu.dartmouth.eureka and org.md2k.data_analysis.feature.phone.app_usage_category has 217 participants data but derived streams have only 70+ participants data
- Metadata says int but sample contains strings - org.md2k.data_analysis.gps_episodes_and_semantic_location_from_places
- Phone activity stream's data descriptor is not descriptive (value-confidence)


























Others
- Metadata is not concise. A user won't be able to know what values he can expect in a sample. Example stream, org.md2k.data_analysis.gps_episodes_and_semantic_location_from_model
- Call durations are averages
